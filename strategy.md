# Strategy for Progressive Migration to Vue 3

Migrating from Vue 2.7 to Vue 3 can be a complex task, especially for large projects. A progressive migration strategy helps manage this complexity by breaking down the migration into manageable steps. Below is a recommended strategy for prioritizing the migration tasks:

## 1. Assess and Plan
- **Inventory:** Use the breaking changes scanner to identify all files affected by breaking changes.
- **Prioritize:** Focus on components and features that are most critical to your application.
- **Dependencies:** Check compatibility of third-party libraries and plugins with Vue 3.

## 2. Global API Changes
- **Objective:** Transition to the new global API structure.
- **Tasks:**
  - Replace `Vue.extend`, `Vue.nextTick`, `Vue.set`, and similar APIs with the new Vue 3 equivalents.

## 3. v-model Behavior Changes
- **Objective:** Update custom components to use the new v-model syntax.
- **Tasks:**
  - Replace `v-bind.sync` and `@input` with `v-model` using `modelValue` and `update:modelValue`.

## 4. Lifecycle Hooks
- **Objective:** Update lifecycle hooks to the new naming conventions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Rename `beforeDestroy` to `beforeUnmount` and `destroyed` to `unmounted`.

## 5. Scoped Slots and Filters
- **Objective:** Adapt to the removal of filters and changes to scoped slots.
- **Tasks:**
  - Replace filters with computed properties or methods.
  - Use `v-slot` for scoped slots.

## 6. Event Bus and Plugin Usage
- **Objective:** Refactor or replace event bus patterns and update plugins.
- **Tasks:**
  - Replace `$on`, `$off`, `$once` with external libraries like `mitt`.
  - Ensure plugins are compatible with Vue 3 or find alternatives.

## 7. Webpack to Vite Migration
- **Objective:** Transition your build setup from Webpack to Vite.
- **Tasks:**
  - Update build configurations to align with Vite's requirements.

## 8. Testing and Validation
- **Objective:** Ensure the application functions correctly after migration.
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct thorough testing, focusing on areas affected by breaking changes.
  - Use automated tests to validate functionality.

## 9. Continuous Improvement
- **Objective:** Maintain and improve the codebase post-migration.
- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor code for better performance and maintainability.
  - Stay updated with the latest Vue 3 features and best practices.

Following this strategy will help ensure a smooth transition to Vue 3, minimizing disruptions and maintaining application stability throughout the migration process.
